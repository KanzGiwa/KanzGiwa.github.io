    <p>Welcome from my partner James Leuk and me at our  "Color Oasis" coloring book game. In Color Oasis, you can select from three different pages to color. As you select a color on each image, you'll drag your mouse on where you want to color on the image. You can choose from three options by clicking the "Select" tab: a food bowl, Boba Tea, and my partner and my first initials. where there are various color options at the beginning of every coloring page. You can choose to go to the next page after clicking the "Start Button," which will automatically take you to the page with the food bowl.  </p>
